## Monday February 7, 2022

Hectic day, but a productive one. Highlight might have been a student 1:1 or teaching 2 students from Cleveland about Machine Learning.

Down energy in the evening, maybe due to a student drop.

Snow starting to melt, but didn't get to walk Jester due to recording content for podcast.

### Plan

- Assist teaching Java - File Input & Exception Handling
- Grade Unit Tests Homework (Manual Grade)
- Recorded Interview with David G. for Technology & Friends
- Go through the final remaining MS Learn content on [[azure.certs.datascientist]] for 30 Days to Learn It Challenge (2 Remaining)

### Productivity
#### Work

- Assist teaching Java - File Input & Exception Handling
- Grade Unit Tests Homework (Manual Grade)
- Employee Engagement Survey
- 1x Student 1:1
- Talked Data Science with 2 students

#### Content

- Recorded Interview with David G. for Technology & Friends

### Learning

- Completed [[courses.learn.deep-learning-with-horovod-distributed-training]]
- Completed [[courses.learn.work-with-azure-machine-learning-deploy-serving-models]]

### Other Notes

- Purchased a bundle of 15 Data Engineering Books via O'Reilly and Humble Bundle
- Signed up for the IBM Data Engineering Capstone on Coursera, but course is not active yet
- Found a need for a single book recommendation to teach beginners the basics of [[langs.python]], [[libs.pandas]], [[libs.plotly]], and maybe [[libs.scikit-learn]]
