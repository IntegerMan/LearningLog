Interesting definitions:
> A hyperparameter is a parameter used in a machine learning algorithm that is set before the learning process begins

> Hyperparameter tuning is the process of choosing the hyperparameter that performs the best on our loss function, or the way we penalize an algorithm for being wrong.
