# FU Notes

Slow speaking pattern is good.

1 Note Sheet for Midterm. Handwritten?

Sigma - Select - Filters out rows.
Pi - Project - Selects columns
Rho (p) - Rename

Degree - # of attributes in a relation

`R(n, n, n) <-` can be used to rename things. Or Rho.


No duplicate rows are possible in Relational Algebra

Intersection (upside down U) - AND - only those in both (inner join)

Set Difference (-)
`R - S` Only things in `R` that are not in `S`

Cartesian Product (Cross Product or Cross Join)
Identified by X

Do not have to be union compatible
If R has N tuples and S has T tuples, RxS will have N*T tuples.

Joins
R >< condition S (bow tie)
Theta join - specify names on both sides

Equijoin - only = is used on join (part of theta join)
Natural join - same names. Denoted by * or ><

Division % - must include all (not on exam)

Full Join - Want everything on either side

Outer Union - Take things that have the same common attributes? **Book review needed.**
