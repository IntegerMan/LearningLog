# Learning Log
A collection of highlights of things I've learned from reading, conferences, and courses as well as lists of resources to investigate.

The contents of this repository are primarily around a [Dendron](https://wiki.dendron.so/) workspace. Open [dendron.code-workspace](/vault/dendron.code-workspace) in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to get started.
